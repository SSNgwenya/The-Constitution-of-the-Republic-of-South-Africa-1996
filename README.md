# The-Constitution-of-the-Republic-of-South-Africa-1996
This project takes information from The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa and turn it into a website that one can easily access. 

I thought I should create this as a practice project but also because I realised that in my grown age, I have absolutely no clue about the laws and constitution of my country. This then made me go find the constitution. It is a long document that in my view is not appetizing to the reader. That is not all, not everyone had access to the document or knows where to get it, well, I'm assuming. 

However, this to me was a greate project to learn how to create a website and as a starting point. I hope those who use it, find it usefull.


To those that go through my code, I'd appreaciate any advice to get better and more efficiant at this.


Thank you and have fun.

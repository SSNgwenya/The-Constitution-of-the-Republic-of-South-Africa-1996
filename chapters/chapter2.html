        <ol type="1">
            <li>The Bill of Rights applies to all law, and binds the legislature, the executive, the 
                <br>judiciary and all organs of state.</li>
            <li>A provision of the Bill of Rights binds a natural or a juristic person if, and to the 
                <br>extent that, it is applicable, taking into account the nature of the right and the 
                <br>nature of any duty imposed by the right.</li>
            <li>When applying a provision of the Bill of Rights to a natural or juristic person in terms 
                <br>of subsection (2), a court—
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>in order to give effect to a right in the Bill, must apply, or if necessary develop,
                        <br>the common law to the extent that legislation does not give effect to that 
                        <br>right; and</li>
                    <li>may develop rules of the common law to limit the right, provided that the 
                        <br>limitation is in accordance with section 36(1).
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>A juristic person is entitled to the rights in the Bill of Rights to the extent required by 
                <br>the nature of the rights and the nature of that juristic person.</li>
        </ol>

                <br>discrimination may be taken.</li>

                <br>social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, 
                <br>culture, language and birth.</li>
            <li>No person may unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or 
                <br>more grounds in terms of subsection (3). National legislation must be enacted to
                <br>prevent or prohibit unfair discrimination.</li>

                                <li>A notice must be published in the national Government Gazette within five

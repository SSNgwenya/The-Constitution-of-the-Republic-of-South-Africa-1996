            <ol type="1">
                <li>Local government and each province—
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>is entitled to an equitable share of revenue raised nationally to enable it to
                            <br>provide basic services and perform the functions allocated to it; and</li>
                        <li>may receive other allocations from national government revenue, either
                            <br>conditionally or unconditionally.</li>

                </li>
                <li>Additional revenue raised by provinces or municipalities may not be deducted from
                    <br>their share of revenue raised nationally, or from other allocations made to 
                    <br>them out of national government revenue. Equally, there is no obligation on the national
                    <br>government to compensate provinces or municipalities that do not raise revenue
                    <br>commensurate with their fiscal capacity and tax base.</li>
                <li>A province’s equitable share of revenue raised nationally must be transferred to
                    <br>the province promptly and without deduction, except when the transfer has been
                    <br>stopped in terms of section 216.</li>
                <li>A province must provide for itself any resources that it requires, in terms of a
                    <br>provision of its provincial constitution, that are additional to its requirements
                    <br>envisaged in the Constitution.</li>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>The judicial authority of the Republic is vested in the courts.</li>
            <li>The courts are independent and subject only to the Constitution and the law, which
                <br>they must apply impartially and without fear, favour or prejudice.</li>
            <li>No person or organ of state may interfere with the functioning of the
                <br>courts.</li>
            <li>Organs of state, through legislative and other measures, must assist and protect
                <br>the courts to ensure the independence, impartiality, dignity, accessibility and
                <br>effectiveness of the courts.</li>
            <li>An order or decision issued by a court binds all persons to whom and organs of state
                <br>to which it applies.</li>
            <li>The Chief Justice is the head of the judiciary and exercises responsibility over the
                <br>establishment and monitoring of norms and standards for the exercise of the
                <br>judicial functions of all courts.</li>

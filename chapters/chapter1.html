                                    <h3> 1. Republic of South Africa</h3>
                    <p>The Republic of South Africa is one, sovereign, democratic state founded on the following
                        <br>values:
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Human dignity, the achievement of equality and the advancement of human
                                <br>rights and freedoms.</li>
                            <li>Non-racialism and non-sexism.</li>
                            <li>Supremacy of the constitution and the rule of law.</li>
                            <li>Universal adult suffrage, a national common voters roll, regular elections and
                                <br>a multi-party system of democratic government, to ensure accountability,
                                <br>responsiveness and openness.</li>
                        </ol>



                                    <h3>2. Supremacy of Constitution</h3>
                <p>This Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic; law or conduct inconsistent with it is
                    <br>invalid, and the obligations imposed by it must be fulfilled.</p>



                                        <h3>3. Citizenship</h3>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>There is a common South African citizenship.</li>
                    <li>All citizens are—
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>equally entitled to the rights, privileges and benefits of citizenship; and,/li>
                            <li>equally subject to the duties and responsibilities of citizenship.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>National legislation must provide for the acquisition, loss and restoration of
                        <br>citizenship.</li>
                </ol>



                                        <h3>4. National anthem</h3>
            <p>The national anthem of the Republic is determined by the President by proclamation.</p>




                                        <h3>5. National flag</h3>
            <p>The national flag of the Republic is black, gold, green, white, red and blue, as described
                <br>and sketched in Schedule 1.</p>



                                        <h3>6. Languages</h3>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>The official languages of the Republic are Sepedi, Sesotho, Setswana, siSwati,
                    <br>Tshivenda, Xitsonga, Afrikaans, English, isiNdebele, isiXhosa and isiZulu.</li>
                <li>Recognising the historically diminished use and status of the indigenous languages
                    <br>of our people, the state must take practical and positive measures to elevate the
                    <br>status and advance the use of these languages.</li>
                <li> <ol type="a">
                            <li>The national government and provincial governments may use any particular
                                <br>official languages for the purposes of government, taking into account usage,
                                <br>practicality, expense, regional circumstances and the balance of the needs and
                                <br>preferences of the population as a whole or in the province concerned; but the
                                <br>national government and each provincial government must use at least two
                                <br>official languages.</li>
                            <li>Municipalities must take into account the language usage and preferences of
                                <br>their residents.</li>
                        </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The national government and provincial governments, by legislative and other
                    <br>measures, must regulate and monitor their use of official languages. Without
                    <br>detracting from the provisions of subsection (2), all official languages must enjoy
                    <br>parity of esteem and must be treated equitably.</li>
                <li>A Pan South African Language Board established by national legislation must—
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>promote, and create conditions for, the development and use of—
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li>all official languages;</li>
                                <li>the Khoi, Nama and San languages; and</li>
                                <li>sign language; and</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>promote and ensure respect for—
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li>all languages commonly used by communities in South Africa, including
                                    <br>German, Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Portuguese, Tamil, Telegu and Urdu; and</li>
                                <li>Arabic, Hebrew, Sanskrit and other languages used for religious purposes
                                    <br>in South Africa.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </lo>

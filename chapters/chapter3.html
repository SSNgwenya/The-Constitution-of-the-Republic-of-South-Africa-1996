                <h3> 40. Government of the Republic</h3>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>In the Republic, government is constituted as national, provincial and local spheres
                    <br>of government which are distinctive, interdependent and interrelated.</li>
                <li>All spheres of government must observe and adhere to the principles in this Chapter
                    <br>and must conduct their activities within the parameters that the Chapter provides.</li>
            </ol>




                    <h3> 41. Principles of co-operative government and intergovernmental relations</h3>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>All spheres of government and all organs of state within each sphere must—
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>preserve the peace, national unity and the indivisibility of the Republic;</li>
                        <li>secure the well-being of the people of the Republic;</li>
                        <li>provide effective, transparent, accountable and coherent government for the
                            <br>Republic as a whole;</li>
                        <li>be loyal to the Constitution, the Republic and its people;</li>
                        </li>respect the constitutional status, institutions, powers and functions of
                            <br>government in the other spheres;</li>
                        <li>not assume any power or function except those conferred on them in terms of
                            <br>the Constitution;</li>
                        <li>exercise their powers and perform their functions in a manner that does
                            <br>not encroach on the geographical, functional or institutional integrity of
                            <br>government in another sphere; and</li>
                        <li>co-operate with one another in mutual trust and good faith by—
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li>fostering friendly relations;</li>
                                <li>assisting and supporting one another;</li>
                                <li>informing one another of, and consulting one another on, matters of
                                    <br>common interest;</li>
                                <li>co-ordinating their actions and legislation with one another;</li>
                                <li>adhering to agreed procedures; and</li>
                                <li>avoiding legal proceedings against one another</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>An Act of Parliament must—
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>establish or provide for structures and institutions to promote and facilitate
                            <br>intergovernmental relations; and</li>
                        <li>provide for appropriate mechanisms and procedures to facilitate settlement of
                            <br>intergovernmental disputes.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>An organ of state involved in an intergovernmental dispute must make every
                    <br>reasonable effort to settle the dispute by means of mechanisms and procedures
                    <br>provided for that purpose, and must exhaust all other remedies before it approaches
                    <br>a court to resolve the dispute.</li>
                <li>If a court is not satisfied that the requirements of subsection (3) have been met, it
                    <br>may refer a dispute back to the organs of state involved.</li>

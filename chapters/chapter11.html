                    <h3>198. Governing principles</h3>
            <p>The following principles govern national security in the Republic:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>National security must reflect the resolve of South Africans, as individuals and
                        <br>as a nation, to live as equals, to live in peace and harmony, to be free from fear
                        <br>and want and to seek a better life.</li>
                    <li>The resolve to live in peace and harmony precludes any South African citizen
                        <br>from participating in armed conflict, nationally or internationally, except as
                        <br>provided for in terms of the Constitution or national legislation.</li>
                    <li>National security must be pursued in compliance with the law, including
                        <br>international law.</li>
                    <li>National security is subject to the authority of Parliament and the national
                        <br>executive.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>


                <h3>199. Establishment, structuring and conduct of security services</h3>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>The security services of the Republic consist of a single defence force, a single police
                    <br>service and any intelligence services established in terms of the Constitution.</li>
                <li>The defence force is the only lawful military force in the Republic.</li>
                <li>Other than the security services established in terms of the Constitution, armed
                    <br>organisations or services may be established only in terms of national legislation.</li>
                <li>The security services must be structured and regulated by national legislation.</li>
                <li>The security services must act, and must teach and require their members to act, in
                    <br>accordance with the Constitution and the law, including customary international
                    <br>law and international agreements binding on the Republic.</li>
                <li>No member of any security service may obey a manifestly illegal order.</li>
                <li>Neither the security services, nor any of their members, may, in the performance of
                    <br>their functions—
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>prejudice a political party interest that is legitimate in terms of the
                            <br>Constitution; or</li>
                        <li>further, in a partisan manner, any interest of a political party.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>To give effect to the principles of transparency and accountability, multi-party
                    <br>parliamentary committees must have oversight of all security services in a manner
                    <br>determined by national legislation or the rules and orders of Parliament.</li>
            </ol>

                <li>The defence force must be structured and managed as a disciplined military force.</li>
                <li>The primary object of the defence force is to defend and protect the Republic, its
                    <br>territorial integrity and its people in accordance with the Constitution and the
                    <br>principles of international law regulating the use of force.</li>

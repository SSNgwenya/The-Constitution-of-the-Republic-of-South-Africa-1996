        <ol type="1">
            <li>The legislative authority of a province is vested in its provincial legislature, and
                <br>confers on the provincial legislature the power—
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>to pass a constitution for its province or to amend any constitution passed by it
                        <br>in terms of sections 142 and 143;</li>
                    <li>to pass legislation for its province with regard to—
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>any matter within a functional area listed in Schedule 4;</li>
                            <li>any matter within a functional area listed in Schedule 5;</li>
                            <li>any matter outside those functional areas, and that is expressly assigned
                                <br>to the province by national legislation; and</li>
                            <li>any matter for which a provision of the Constitution envisages the
                                <br>enactment of provincial legislation; and</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>to assign any of its legislative powers to a Municipal Council in that province.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The legislature of a province, by a resolution adopted with a supporting vote of at
                <br>least two thirds of its members, may request Parliament to change the name of that
                <br>province.</li>
            <li>A provincial legislature is bound only by the Constitution and, if it has passed a
                <br>constitution for its province, also by that constitution, and must act in accordance
                <br>with, and within the limits of, the Constitution and that provincial constitution.</li>
            <li>Provincial legislation with regard to a matter that is reasonably necessary for, or
                <br>incidental to, the effective exercise of a power concerning any matter listed in
                <br>Schedule 4, is for all purposes legislation with regard to a matter listed in Schedule
                <br>4.</li>
            <li>A provincial legislature may recommend to the National Assembly legislation
                <br>concerning any matter outside the authority of that legislature, or in respect of
                <br>which an Act of Parliament prevails over a provincial law.</li>

                    <li>provides for a minimum voting age of 18 years; and</li>

            <br>Constitution Fourteenth Amendment Act of 2008.]</p>
            <li>A provincial legislature consists of between 30 and 80 members. The number of
                <br>members, which may differ among the provinces, must be determined in terms of a

                    <h3>146. Conflicts between national and provincial legislation</h3>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>This section applies to a conflict between national legislation and provincial
                <br>legislation falling within a functional area listed in Schedule 4.</li>
            <li>National legislation that applies uniformly with regard to the country as a whole
                <br>prevails over provincial legislation if any of the following conditions is met:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>The national legislation deals with a matter that cannot be regulated
                        <br>effectively by legislation enacted by the respective provinces individually.</li>
                    <li>The national legislation deals with a matter that, to be dealt with effectively,
                        <br>requires uniformity across the nation, and the national legislation provides
                        <br>that uniformity by establishing—
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>norms and standards;</li>
                            <li>frameworks; or</li>
                            <li>national policies.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>The national legislation is necessary for—
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>the maintenance of national security;</li>
                            <li>the maintenance of economic unity;</li>
                            <li>the protection of the common market in respect of the mobility of goods,
                                <br>services, capital and labour;</li>
                            <li>the promotion of economic activities across provincial boundaries;</li>
                            <li>the promotion of equal opportunity or equal access to government
                                <br>services; or</li>
                            <li>the protection of the environment.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>National legislation prevails over provincial legislation if the national legislation is
                <br>aimed at preventing unreasonable action by a province that—
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>is prejudicial to the economic, health or security interests of another province
                        <br>or the country as a whole; or</li>
                    <li>impedes the implementation of national economic policy.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>When there is a dispute concerning whether national legislation is necessary for
                <br>a purpose set out in subsection (2)(c) and that dispute comes before a court for
                <br>resolution, the court must have due regard to the approval or the rejection of the
                <br>legislation by the National Council of Provinces.</li>
            <li>Provincial legislation prevails over national legislation if subsection (2) or (3) does
                <br>not apply.</li>
            <li>A law made in terms of an Act of Parliament or a provincial Act can prevail only if
                <br>that law has been approved by the National Council of Provinces.</li>
            <li>If the National Council of Provinces does not reach a decision within 30 days of
                <br>its first sitting after a law was referred to it, that law must be considered for all
                <br>purposes to have been approved by the Council.</li>
            <li>If the National Council of Provinces does not approve a law referred to in subsection
                <br>(6), it must, within 30 days of its decision, forward reasons for not approving the
                <br>law to the authority that referred the law to it.</li>
        </ol>



                    <h3>147. Other conflicts</h3>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>If there is a conflict between national legislation and a provision of a provincial
                <br>constitution with regard to—
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>a matter concerning which this Constitution specifically requires or
                        <br>envisages the enactment of national legislation, the national legislation
                        <br>prevails over the affected provision of the provincial constitution;</li>
                    <li>national legislative intervention in terms of section 44 (2), the national
                        <br>legislation prevails over the provision of the provincial constitution; or</li>
                    <li>a matter within a functional area listed in Schedule 4, section 146 applies as if
                        <br>the affected provision of the provincial constitution were provincial legislation
                        <br>referred to in that section.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>National legislation referred to in section 44(2) prevails over provincial legislation in
                <br>respect of matters within the functional areas listed in Schedule 5.</li>
        </ol>



                            <h3>148. Conflicts that cannot be resolved</h3>
        <p>If a dispute concerning a conflict cannot be resolved by a court, the national legislation
            <br>prevails over the provincial legislation or provincial constitution.</p>


                        <h3>149. Status of legislation that does not prevail</h3>
        <p>A decision by a court that legislation prevails over other legislation does not invalidate that
            <br>other legislation, but that other legislation becomes inoperative for as long as the conflict
            <br>remains.</p>



                    <h3>150. Interpretation of conflicts</h3>
        <p>When considering an apparent conflict between national and provincial legislation, or
            <br>between national legislation and a provincial constitution, every court must prefer any
            <br>reasonable interpretation of the legislation or constitution that avoids a conflict, over any
            <br>alternative interpretation that results in a conflict.</p>

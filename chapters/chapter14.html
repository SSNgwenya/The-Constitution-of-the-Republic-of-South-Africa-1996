                            <h2>International Law</h2>
                        <h3>231. International agreements</h3>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>The negotiating and signing of all international agreements is the responsibility of
                        <br>the national executive.</li>
                    <li>An international agreement binds the Republic only after it has been approved by
                        <br>resolution in both the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces,
                        <br>unless it is an agreement referred to in subsection (3).</li>
                    <li>An international agreement of a technical, administrative or executive nature, or
                        <br>an agreement which does not require either ratification or accession, entered into
                        <br>by the national executive, binds the Republic without approval by the National
                        <br>Assembly and the National Council of Provinces, but must be tabled in the Assembly
                        <br>and the Council within a reasonable time.</li>
                    <li>Any international agreement becomes law in the Republic when it is enacted into
                        <br>law by national legislation; but a self-executing provision of an agreement that has
                        <br>been approved by Parliament is law in the Republic unless it is inconsistent with the
                        <br>Constitution or an Act of Parliament.</li>
                    <li>The Republic is bound by international agreements which were binding on the
                        <br>Republic when this Constitution took effect.</li>
                </ol>



                                    <h3>232. Customary international law</h3>
                <p>Customary international law is law in the Republic unless it is inconsistent with the
                    <br>Constitution or an Act of Parliament.</p>



                                    <h3>233. Application of international law</h3>
                <p>When interpreting any legislation, every court must prefer any reasonable interpretation
                    <br>of the legislation that is consistent with international law over any alternative
                    <br>interpretation that is inconsistent with international law.</p>



                                        <h2>Other Matters</h2>
                                    <h3>234. Charters of Rights</h3>
                <p>In order to deepen the culture of democracy established by the Constitution, Parliament
                    <br>may adopt Charters of Rights consistent with the provisions of the Constitution.</p>



                                    <h3>235. Self-determination</h3>
                <p>The right of the South African people as a whole to self-determination, as manifested in
                    <br>this Constitution, does not preclude, within the framework of this right, recognition of the
                    <br>notion of the right of self-determination of any community sharing a common cultural
                    <br>and language heritage, within a territorial entity in the Republic or in any other way,
                    <br>determined by national legislation.</p>



                                    <h3>236. Funding for political parties</h3>
                <p>To enhance multi-party democracy, national legislation must provide for the funding of
                    <br>political parties participating in national and provincial legislatures on an equitable and
                    <br>proportional basis.</p>




                            <h3>237. Diligent performance of obligations</h3>
                <p>All constitutional obligations must be performed diligently and without delay.</p>




                                <h3>238. Agency and delegation</h3>
                <p>An executive organ of state in any sphere of government may—
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>delegate any power or function that is to be exercised or performed in terms
                            <br>of legislation to any other executive organ of state, provided the delegation is
                            <br>consistent with the legislation in terms of which the power is exercised or the
                            <br>function is performed; or</li>
                        <li>exercise any power or perform any function for any other executive organ of
                            <br>state on an agency or delegation basis.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>




                                    <h3>239. Definitions</h3>

                            <br>“organ of state” means—

                    <p>In the event of an inconsistency between different texts of the Constitution, the English
                        <br>text prevails.</p>



                                    <h3>241. Transitional arrangements</h3>
                    <p>Schedule 6 applies to the transition to the new constitutional order established by this

                                <h3>243. Short title and commencement</h3>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>This Act is called the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, and comes
                        <br>into effect as soon as possible on a date set by the President by proclamation, which
                        <br>may not be a date later than 1 July 1997.</li>
                    <li>The President may set different dates before the date mentioned in subsection (1) in
                        <br>respect of different provisions of the Constitution.</li>
                    <li>Unless the context otherwise indicates, a reference in a provision of the Constitution
                        <br>to a time when the Constitution took effect must be construed as a reference to the
                        <br>time when that provision took effect.</li>
                    <li>If a different date is set for any particular provision of the Constitution in terms of
                        <br>subsection (2), any corresponding provision of the Constitution of the Republic of
                        <br>South Africa, 1993 (Act 200 of 1993), mentioned in the proclamation, is repealed
                        <br>with effect from the same date.</li>
                    <li>Sections 213, 214, 215, 216, 218, 226, 227, 228, 229 and 230 come into effect on 1
                        <br>January 1998, but this does not preclude the enactment in terms of this Constitution
                        <br>of legislation envisaged in any of these provisions before that date. Until that date
                        <br>any corresponding and incidental provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of
                        <br>South Africa, 1993, remain in force.</li>

                    <h3>195. Basic values and principles governing public administration</h3>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Public administration must be governed by the democratic values and principles
                    <br>enshrined in the Constitution, including the following principles:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>A high standard of professional ethics must be promoted and maintained.</li>
                        <li>Efficient, economic and effective use of resources must be promoted.</li>
                        <li>Public administration must be development-oriented.</li>
                        <li>Services must be provided impartially, fairly, equitably and without bias.</li>
                        <li>People’s needs must be responded to, and the public must be encouraged to
                            <br>participate in policy-making.</li>
                        <li>Public administration must be accountable.</li>
                        <li>Transparency must be fostered by providing the public with timely, accessible
                            <br>and accurate information.</li>
                        <li>Good human-resource management and career-development practices, to
                            <br>maximise human potential, must be cultivated.</li>
                        <li>Public administration must be broadly representative of the South African
                            <br>people, with employment and personnel management practices based on
                            <br>ability, objectivity, fairness, and the need to redress the imbalances of the past
                            <br>to achieve broad representation.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The above principles apply to—
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>administration in every sphere of government;</li>
                        <li>organs of state; and</li>
                        <li>public enterprises.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>National legislation must ensure the promotion of the values and principles listed in
                    <br>subsection (1).</li>
                <li>The appointment in public administration of a number of persons on policy
                    <br>considerations is not precluded, but national legislation must regulate these
                    <br>appointments in the public service.</li>
                <li>Legislation regulating public administration may differentiate between different
                    <br>sectors, administrations or institutions.</li>
                <li>The nature and functions of different sectors, administrations or institutions of
                    <br>public administration are relevant factors to be taken into account in legislation
                    <br>regulating public administration.</li>
            </ol>

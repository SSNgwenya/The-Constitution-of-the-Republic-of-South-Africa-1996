                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Parliament consists of—
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>the National Assembly; and</li>

                        <br>legislative process in the manner set out in the Constitution.</li>
                    <li>The National Assembly is elected to represent the people and to ensure government
                        <br>by the people under the Constitution. It does this by choosing the President, by
                        <br>providing a national forum for public consideration of issues, by passing legislation
                        <br>and by scrutinizing and overseeing executive action.</li>
                    <li>The National Council of Provinces represents the provinces to ensure that provincial
                        <br>interests are taken into account in the national sphere of government. It does
                        <br>this mainly by participating in the national legislative process and by providing a
                        <br>national forum for public consideration of issues affecting the provinces.</li>
                    <li>The President may summon Parliament to an extraordinary sitting at any time to
                        <br>conduct special business.</li>
                    <li>The seat of Parliament is Cape Town, but an Act of Parliament enacted in accordance
                        <br>with section 76(1) and (5) may determine that the seat of Parliament is elsewhere.</li>

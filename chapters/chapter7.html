                        <h3>151. Status of municipalities</h3>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>The local sphere of government consists of municipalities, which must be
                    <br>established for the whole of the territory of the Republic.</li>
                <li>The executive and legislative authority of a municipality is vested in its Municipal
                    <br>Council.</li>
                <li>A municipality has the right to govern, on its own initiative, the local
                    <br>government affairs of its community, subject to national and provincial legislation,
                    <br>as provided for in the Constitution.</li>
                <li>The national or a provincial government may not compromise or impede a
                    <br>municipality’s ability or right to exercise its powers or perform its functions.</li>
            </ol>



                        <h3>152. Objects of local government</h3>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>The objects of local government are—
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>to provide democratic and accountable government for local communities;</li>
                        <li>to ensure the provision of services to communities in a sustainable manner;</li>
                        <li>to promote social and economic development;</li>
                        <li>to promote a safe and healthy environment; and</li>
                        <li>to encourage the involvement of communities and community organisations
                            <br>in the matters of local government.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>A municipality must strive, within its financial and administrative capacity, to
                    <br>achieve the objects set out in subsection (1).</li>
            </ol>



                        <h3>153. Developmental duties of municipalities</h3>
            <p>A municipality must—
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>structure and manage its administration and budgeting and planning
                        <br>processes to give priority to the basic needs of the community, and to promote
                        <br>the social and economic development of the community; and</li>
                    <li>participate in national and provincial development programmes.</li>
                </ol>



                        <h3>154. Municipalities in co-operative government</h3>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>The national government and provincial governments, by legislative and other
                    <br>measures, must support and strengthen the capacity of municipalities to manage
                    <br>their own affairs, to exercise their powers and to perform their functions.</li>
                <li>Draft national or provincial legislation that affects the status, institutions, powers
                    <br>or functions of local government must be published for public comment before
                    <br>it is introduced in Parliament or a provincial legislature, in a manner that allows
                    <br>organised local government, municipalities and other interested persons an
                    <br>opportunity to make representations with regard to the draft legislation.</li>
            </ol>



                        <h3>155. Establishment of municipalities</h3>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>There are the following categories of municipality:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Category A: A municipality that has exclusive municipal executive and
                            <br>legislative authority in its area.</li>
                        <li>Category B: A municipality that shares municipal executive and legislative
                            <br>authority in its area with a category C municipality within whose area it falls.</li>
                        <li>Category C: A municipality that has municipal executive and legislative
                            <br>authority in an area that includes more than one municipality.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>National legislation must define the different types of municipality that may be
                    <br>established within each category.</li>
                <li>National legislation must—
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>establish the criteria for determining when an area should have a single
                            <br>category A municipality or when it should have municipalities of both category
                            <br>B and category C;</li>
                        <li>establish criteria and procedures for the determination of municipal
                            <br>boundaries by an independent authority; and</li>
                        <li>subject to section 229, make provision for an appropriate division of powers
                            <br>and functions between municipalities when an area has municipalities of
                            <br>both category B and category C. A division of powers and functions between
                            <br>a category B municipality and a category C municipality may differ from the
                            <br>division of powers and functions between another category B municipality and
                            <br>that category C municipality.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The legislation referred to in subsection (3) must take into account the need to
                    <br>provide municipal services in an equitable and sustainable manner.</li>
                <li>Provincial legislation must determine the different types of municipality to be
                    <br>established in the province.</li>
                <li>Each provincial government must establish municipalities in its province in a
                    <br>manner consistent with the legislation enacted in terms of subsections (2) and (3)
                    <br>and, by legislative or other measures, must—
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>provide for the monitoring and support of local government in the province;
                            <br>and</li>
                        <li>promote the development of local government capacity to enable
                            <br>municipalities to perform their functions and manage their own affairs.</li>
                    </ol>

                <li>The national government, subject to section 44, and the provincial governments
                    <br>have the legislative and executive authority to see to the effective performance by
                    <br>municipalities of their functions in respect of matters listed in Schedules 4 and 5, by
                    <br>regulating the exercise by municipalities of their executive authority referred to in

                    <br>legislation is invalid. If there is a conflict between a bylaw and national or provincial
                    <br>legislation that is inoperative because of a conflict referred to in section 149, the

                </li>
                <li>A municipality has the right to exercise any power concerning a matter reasonably
